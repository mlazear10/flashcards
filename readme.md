#Flashcards

Flashcards is a game that uses node.js and the npm package inquirer to ask questions in the terminal to the user from history, quotes, and other areas of interest. The game cycles through the questions and at the end of the game asks if you want to play again.  It also keeps track of your flashcards score.

Good luck playing!
